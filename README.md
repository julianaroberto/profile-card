# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

![Design preview for the Social links profile coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

What I did:
- HTML: div, class, p, button
- CSS: layout, colors, media queries

What I tried for the first time:
- flexbox *(I still need to improve)*
- hover
- button
- media queries *(I still need to improve)*
